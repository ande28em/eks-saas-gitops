## Overview

The EKS SaaS GitOps Workshop provides a comprehensive template for implementing GitOps practices in a multi-tenant SaaS environment using Amazon EKS. This repository serves as a foundation to generate multiple component repositories, enabling a hands-on GitOps experience. It provides all the necessary patterns, configurations, and scripts to deploy a scalable SaaS application.

This guidance addresses the following key points:

- Provides a simplified process for setting up a GitOps workflow for SaaS applications on EKS
- Includes pre-configured templates and scripts for tenant onboarding and management
- Aims to reduce the learning curve associated with implementing GitOps in a SaaS context
- Allows users to focus on SaaS-specific concerns rather than infrastructure setup

The motivation behind this project is to accelerate and simplify the process of implementing GitOps practices in a SaaS environment. We've heard from customers that there can be a learning curve associated with deploying multi-tenant applications using GitOps principles. This project aims to simplify the undifferentiated lifting, allowing you to focus on your SaaS business logic.

## Features and Benefits

## Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy the EKS SaaS GitOps guidance:

1. **Deploy the VSCode Server Instance**:
   - Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console in your AWS account
   - Click "Create stack" and select "With new resources (standard)"
   - Choose "Upload a template file" and upload the `helpers/vs-code-ec2.yaml` file from this repository
   - Click "Next" and provide a stack name (e.g., "eks-saas-gitops-vscode")
   - Configure any required parameters and click "Next"
   - Review the configuration and click "Create stack"
   - Wait for the CloudFormation stack to complete deployment (approximately 30 minutes)
   - The Terraform infrastructure is deployed automatically as part of the VSCode server instance setup
   - The VSCode instance has all required tools pre-installed (AWS CLI, Terraform, Git, kubectl, Helm, and Flux CLI)

2. **Access the VSCode Server Instance**:
   - Once the CloudFormation stack deployment is complete, go to the "Outputs" tab
   - Find the `VsCodePassword` and click on the link, copy the password under `Value`
   - Find the `VSCodeURL` output value and click on the link
   - This will open the VSCode web interface in your browser
   - Input the password copied from `VsCodePassword`
   - The repository connected to Flux and your Amazon EKS Cluster will be automatically cloned and available in the VSCode workspace on `/home/ec2-user/environment/gitops-gitea-repo`
   - If you want to understand the infrastructure components or make customizations, you can review the terraform directory:
     ```
     cd /home/ec2-user/environment/eks-saas-gitops/terraform
     ```
   - The `environment/eks-saas-gitops` is the repo used to create the entire Stack, the `environment/gitops-gitea-repo` is the Gitea repo connected to Flux and the EKS Cluster.
   - For more detailed information about the infrastructure, refer to the [terraform/README.md](terraform/README.md) file

4. **Explore the GitOps Implementation**:
   - After the infrastructure deployment is complete, you can explore the GitOps implementation and tenant onboarding process
   - The sample microservices and Helm charts are available in their respective directories
   - Use the workflow scripts to automate tenant onboarding and application deployment

For more detailed instructions and advanced configurations, refer to the [terraform/README.md](terraform/README.md) file.
